# OSA Phenotyper Prototype – v5

### Added WatchPAT detail
* **Supine pAHI, REM pAHI, NREM pAHI** fields.
* Positional & REM‑predominant rules now run for WatchPAT when those values are entered (simple heuristics: Supine pAHI > 2× overall pAHI and overall < 20; REM pAHI > 2× NREM pAHI and REM ≥ 10).

Everything else from v4 remains.
